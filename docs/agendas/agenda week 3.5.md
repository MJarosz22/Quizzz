### Check on code of conduct

Everything is fine, noone has any remarks.

### TA discussion

Quesion: How do we design Sprint?<br>
Our response: We don't have any conflicts, we work as a team, we think what to do next and someone assigns themselves to the given task.

**FLAGS**:

**RED FLAG** on task distribution<br>
**RED FLAG** on splitting the big tasks<br><br>
Advice given:
* Have a meeting; choose a topic; choose, say, 15 issues and distribute them equally. Have in mind that some issues are bigger than other.
* Split the issues into smaller ones. Create subissues.
* Look at previous sprints' boards. Let people who did less then do more now.
* Look at the gitInspector file sent on mattermost- not equal distribution of work.
* Create new issues as soon as new tasks appear.

Flags will be reflected in the final grade.

**MERGE REQUESTS**: At least one merge request per person every week.

**TESTING**: some methods are not tested. 

**SET OUR OWN DEADLINES**: we decided the deadline for all the must-haves is this week, all the should-haves next week (we might be done earlier).<br>

Remark to Joshua: discuss before you replace someone else's code.<br>
General advice: First give feedback to the person. Then let THEM change.

### Question round

- Petra: Picking 20 questions at the beginning of the game.<br>
  Answer: The way we do it is fine.

## Closing

Closed at 3.30.
