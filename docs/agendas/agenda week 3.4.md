## Reflection on last week

- Everyone did the Information Literacy assignment
- We achieved the final version of our Code of Conduct (after reviewing it as a team and replacing it on GitLab)
- We evaluated group 64 prototype for their HCI report.
- We delivered a draft for the HCI report.
- We started working on the implementation part of our project (Set up the primary stage, 2 scenes, adding activities to our activity repository feature, provided some tests regarding what we've already implemented).
- We provided 20 activities in the given format and pushed them to the repository-bank.
- Each of us created at least one API endpoint and also reviewed some code from other members. 



## Questions for the TA

- Is the Agenda properly done?
- Is the HCI document well-structured? What else do we need to improve / change regarding it?
- Are we still on-track? Do you have any piece of advice on what to do next regarding the code?
- Is it alright if we post the agenda on **dev** branch and merge everything on **main** at the end of the week? 


## Question round

- If anyone has any questions address them now



## Closing

- Good job for the previous week!


## Tips and Tops:

### Team:
Tips: 
- When an idea that you do not agree with comes into discussion, start an argue and try to get people by your side, by coming up with concrete arguments explaining why your solution / idea works better then the one proposed by the chairman.
 
Tops: 
- Everyone listens carefully and notes what is discussed during the meeting (even though the notetaker is required to do so, they come into his/her help) .

### Chairman: 
Tips:
- Encourage other members to stick into discussion even more.

Tops: 
- The agenda was posted on time (on Monday), it was clear and stated all the upcoming tasks. Also, the meeting was conducted as intended, having all the peers focused on his discourse. Lastly, the agenda covered all the deadlines regarding week 3.4.
