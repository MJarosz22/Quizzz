## Reflection on last week

- Everyone did the Information Literacy assignment
- We achieved the final version of our Code of Conduct (after reviewing it as a team and replacing it on GitLab)
- We evaluated group 64 prototype for their HCI report.
- We delivered a draft for the HCI report.
- We started working on the implementation part of our project (Set up the primary stage, 2 scenes, adding activities to our activity repository feature, provided some tests regarding what we've already implemented).
- We provided 20 activities in the given format and pushed them to the repository-bank.
- Each of us created at least one API endpoint and also reviewed some code from other members. 



## Questions for the TA

- Is the Agenda properly done?
- Is the HCI document well-structured? What else do we need to improve / change regarding it?
- Are we still on-track? Do you have any piece of advice on what to do next regarding the code?


## Question round

- If anyone has any questions address them now



## Closing

- Good job for the previous week!
