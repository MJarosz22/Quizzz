## Reflection on last week

- Installed the required software and tested it on the repository-template to make sure everything works fine.
- We chose the next chairman(Rafael) and secretary(Vlad).
- Had an additional meeting to update issues on GitLab.
- We met all deadlines scheduled for last Friday (18.02.2022): posted our Backlog issues on GitLab (by adhering to TA’s tips, such as: describing each issue, adding relevant labels to each issue, making sure for completeness and consistency), done Assignment 1A individually (by reading the indicated chapters on BS) and Assignment 2B (Code of Conduct) in team.
- Participated actively as a team to the guest lecture regarding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), after our additional meeting where we re-checked our weekly assignments, we attended online the Client Q&A part 2 lecture as a team, discussing the new issues we should address (after our client clarified some requests) and noted some relevant responses of Sebastian to other groups’ questions. 
- Discussed with our TA regarding our previous work to make sure we are on track as a group. 
- We need to find another team to group with in order to evaluate their HCI assignment.
