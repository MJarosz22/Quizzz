## Reflection on last week

- Installed the required software and tested it on the repository-template to make sure everything works fine.
- We chose the next chairman (Rafael) and secretary (Vlad).
- Had an additional meeting to update issues on GitLab.
- We met all deadlines scheduled for last Friday (18.02.2022): posted our Backlog issues on GitLab (by adhering to TA’s tips, such as: describing each issue, adding relevant labels to each issue, making sure for completeness and consistency), done Assignment 1A individually (by reading the indicated chapters on BS) and Assignment 2B (Code of Conduct) in team.
- Participated actively as a team to the guest lecture regarding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), after our additional meeting where we re-checked our weekly assignments, we attended online the Client Q&A part 2 lecture as a team, discussing the new issues we should address (after our client clarified some requests) and noted some relevant responses of Sebastian to other groups’ questions. 
- Discussed with our TA regarding our previous work to make sure we are on track as a group. 
- We need to find another team to group with in order to evaluate their HCI assignment.


## Questions for the TA

- Feedback for template?
- Where to put activities (for the quizzz)?

## Question round

- If anyone has any questions address them now


## Closing

- Good job this previous week!

# Plans for this week
- Schedule another meeting before the “official” meeting on Thursday in order to prepare the mock up for the game.
- Agreed on the team we will group with to evaluate each others HCI assignments 
- Have the HCI mock-up finished by Friday’s deadline (preferable on Tuesday so that we can ask our TA for feedback) and also do the Assignments 3A and 3B (which are both team assignments).
- Add check style after agreeing as a team on some basic rules regarding coding standards (indentation, spacing, etc.) . -> between 5 and 10 rules.
- Enrol to CSE Information Literacy 1 course and go through BS exercises provided for this course. Note that this is a mandatory assignment, deadlined on Sunday (27th Feb.)
- We will compare our Backlog to the official one (when it is released) and check whether we’ve missed any issue. If so, we will update our issues so that they will be similar to the official document.
- Decide on the implementation on propagating data (polling, long-polling or WebSockets).
