- how the presentation works : we send the video and then they ask questions about code 
(everyone should be able to give an overview) and also questions from HCI report
(make sure to review it)

## Presentation
- in week ten (either 13 or 14 of april)
- submit the video by the end of week 9
- video: make it before the deadline so the TA can review and give feedback
- video has time limit so only show the application and include as many features as we can
- record how you play the game


## Remarks from the TA
- in week 5 lecturers looked at gitinspector and the TA's notes and are going to send emails to people who didn't contribute enough
- they will ask the people to make a plan for how to improve
- the TA will decide if the work is enough
- ensure these people have more issues to work on
- not enough comments might get emails about that
- make sure to check emails today

## Team discussion questions
- how is communication going - everyone is pretty responsive
- is everyone familiar with both front and back end - yes
- feedback for the course - scene builder is awful
